# Museum of Medicine Interactive Exhibit

This repository contains the code for an interactive application developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction course at the University of Ioannina. The application is designed to enhance visitor engagement at the Museum of the History of Medicine by providing interactive experiences related to the museum's exhibits.

## About the Museum

The Museum of the History of Medicine at the University of Ioannina was founded in 1995. It houses over 20,000 artifacts that reflect the evolution of Greek medicine throughout the centuries. The museum's collection includes significant medical artifacts from antiquity, illustrations of pharmaceutical plants and herbs, a chapel with icons of 65 male doctors and 12 female doctors who obtained sainthood, coins, banknotes, medical comic strips, and a comprehensive collection of 450 Greek stamps on medical topics.

## Project Overview

The interactive application aims to provide visitors with a deeper understanding of the museum's exhibits through engaging digital experiences. Developed using Unity, the application allows users to interact with 3D models of medical artifacts, view detailed information, and explore the historical context of each item.
